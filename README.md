# BTC-Historical-Dataset-


Bitcoin charts for the data. The various exchange APIs, for making it difficult or unintuitive enough to 
get OHLC and volume data at 1-min intervals that I set out on this data scraping project. Satoshi 
Nakamoto and the novel core concept of the blockchain, as well as its first execution via the bitcoin 
protocol. I'd also like to thank viewers like you! Can't wait to see what code or insights you all have to share.
